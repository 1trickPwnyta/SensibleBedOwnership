Makes the bed ownership/assignment mechanic sensible. Specifically:
- Everyone can have a bed assigned per map, so beds don't get unassigned while caravaning.
- Adds the ability to select a colonist or animal and right-click on a bed to assign. Multiple selected pawns can be assigned to a double bed at once.
- Adds a search bar to the bed assignment dialog.
- When assigning a second member to a double bed, brings the first member's love partners to the top of the list.
- Adds an unassignment gizmo when you click on a bed.
- Also applies these features to other colonist-assigned buildings, such as thrones and deathrest caskets.
- Allows pawns to find a chair to sleep in instead of resorting to the ground when no bed is available because chairs still provide comfort when sleeping (can be turned off in settings).
